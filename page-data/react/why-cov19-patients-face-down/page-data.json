Rather than receiving intricate medicaitons or vaccines, they are simple being placed face-down in their hospital bed in a practice known as proning. This change in position is often enough to improve lung functionality and reduce the impact of respiratory distress in Covid-19 cases.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The Lungs and Gravity","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"heading-1"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The lungs are remarkably complex in functionality. As the primary interface for gas exchange in the body, the lungs are a dynamic organ that responds to minute changes in the internal and external environments to maximize oxygen transfer and carbon dioxide removal. As the body inspires, air is pulled through the airways into a network of microscopic sacs called alveoli, where on the others side of a thin barrier millions of capillaries no wider than a single blood cell are waiting with red blood cells lined up ready to receive the incoming oxygen. Based on the demand, position and health of the lungs, this network of blood vessels dilate and constrict to maximize gas transfer all under the orchestration of hormone and nerve signals. In one breath, the lungs saturate the blood in the pulmonary system with oxygen to be transferred throughout the body to meet metabolic demand.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"The lungs are positioned within the thoracic cage, but are not technically attached to anything other than the airways and blood vessels that supply them. When you inspire, muscles that expand the thoracic cavity — the diaphragm and accessory muscles surrounding the ribs — pull the chest wall away from the lungs. Between the lung tissue itself and the inner wall of the chest is an enclosed space called the pleural cavity. When the chest wall draws away from the lungs, the pressure in the pleural cavity (intrapleural pressure) drops to the point that it is less than the pressure inside the alveoli (intra-alveolar pressure), which forces the lung tissue to expand as if they were being sucked toward the chest wall. As the lung tissue expands, the alveoli open and draw air into them.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"image":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3888888888888888,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/5Ds1dqfBawIfZKrTETqmKU/eb874c801a205b72fbde3de60e491339/facedown.jpeg?w=2048&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/5Ds1dqfBawIfZKrTETqmKU/eb874c801a205b72fbde3de60e491339/facedown.jpeg?w=512&h=369&q=50 512w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/5Ds1dqfBawIfZKrTETqmKU/eb874c801a205b72fbde3de60e491339/facedown.jpeg?w=1024&h=737&q=50 1024w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/5Ds1dqfBawIfZKrTETqmKU/eb874c801a205b72fbde3de60e491339/facedown.jpeg?w=1400&h=1008&q=50 1400w","sizes":"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2Qm6kh1jJnt6jxRjTcGeQk"}}}
