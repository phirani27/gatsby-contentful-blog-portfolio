I remember thinking, “How will this lady be able to read my past lives over the phone?” — As if an in-person past lives reading would be totally accurate and authentic. Still, what did I have to lose (other than what’s left of my credibility as a logical person)? The voice on the other end of the line told me that I have been a woman in almost every lifetime, which she said was unusual. Then she told me I hadn’t had a good relationship since Ancient Greece. To which I replied, “I knew I was in a slump, but… wow.” She said I could have kids if I wanted — apparently I’ve raised a lot of children over the centuries. I even had some relatively happy years in Ireland. (You know you’ve had it rough when the potato famine was a highlight.) But my job this time around, she said, was to learn how to love and be loved.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"document"}},"image":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.4973262032085561,"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/2J16RIf66Qlwjvu8lPgxTl/67f90d6bc8bf65ff93789c793fcab708/love.jpeg?w=2048&q=50","srcSet":"//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/2J16RIf66Qlwjvu8lPgxTl/67f90d6bc8bf65ff93789c793fcab708/love.jpeg?w=512&h=342&q=50 512w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/2J16RIf66Qlwjvu8lPgxTl/67f90d6bc8bf65ff93789c793fcab708/love.jpeg?w=1024&h=684&q=50 1024w,\n//images.ctfassets.net/k6zu3w7d9zcg/2J16RIf66Qlwjvu8lPgxTl/67f90d6bc8bf65ff93789c793fcab708/love.jpeg?w=1400&h=935&q=50 1400w","sizes":"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2hLAdRRDg8XSNTLmvO9gME"}}}
